# UK Sales Analysis Project

This is a simple data analysis project I did using Python. The main goal of this project was to analyze monthly sales data of a store and understand which products were sold the most, in which month sales were highest, and some other interesting patterns.

## What I did

I worked with multiple Excel/CSV files that had sales data of each month. First, I combined all the files into one using Python and pandas. Then I cleaned the data (removed not a number values and fixed some wrong entries). After that, I analyzed the data to answer some questions like:

- Which month had the highest sales?
- What product was sold the most?
- At what time do most orders happen?
- Which city had the highest number of orders?

I used matplotlib and seaborn libraries to make graphs to help understand the data better.

## Tools I used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Why I did this ?
->
  I am learning data analysis and wanted to do a hands-on project to understand how to work with real datasets. This project helped me practice data cleaning, merging, and visualization.



## How to open this project

-> If you want to see this project:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells step by step
