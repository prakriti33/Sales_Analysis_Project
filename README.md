# UK Sales Analysis Project 

- This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project where I analyzed UK sales data using Python.

- The goal was to understand sales trends, like which products sold the most, which months had the highest sales, and other useful insights.

- I worked with multiple monthly sales files, combined them into one dataset, cleaned the data, and then analyzed it using Python libraries.

- All the graphs and charts are inside the Jupyter Notebook to help visualize the findings.

## Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## How to Use ?

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.  
3. Run the cells step-by-step to see the analysis and graphs.
